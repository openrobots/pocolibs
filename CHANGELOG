Version 2.0, xx April 2004

8. Add support for rpcgen -C in posterServ. Removes one of the 
   last #ifdef <system>, and makes this stuff build on MacOS X.
7. Split aclocal.m4. 
6. Effectively handle the possibility to disable X11 (xes).
5. Look for rpcgen instead of blindly using `rpcgen' (useful for
   cross-compiling).
4. Install include files (Anthony Mallet).
3. Fix detection of thread-related options in C compilers.
2. Adapt the build system to use GNU configure and libtool.
1. Import the current internal LAAS version

$LAAS$
